<h1> Exploring JavaScript </h1>

Diving into the world of JavaScript and exploring the versatile nature of it via arrays, functions, Math, methods, if else, switch case, counter and loop etc elements.

<h2> Objects & Arrays </h2>

Objects allow us to group related data and functions, while arrays help organize and manipulate ordered collections of values.

<h2> Functions </h2>

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They enhance code organization and maintainability.

<h2> Math </h2>

The Math object in JavaScript provides a range of mathematical functions and constants. It's handy for tasks like rounding numbers, generating random numbers, or performing complex calculations.

<h2> If else </h2>

Conditional statements in JS, like if and else, allow us to execute different code based on specific conditions.

<h2> Switch Case </h2>

The switch statement provides a way to perform different actions based on the value of a variable. It's an alternative to multiple if statements.

<h2> Counter </h2>

A counter is a variable that keeps track of a numerical value and allows us to keep a record of how many times a specific action or event has occurred within your code.

<h2> Loop </h2>

Loops enable the execution of a set of instructions repeatedly until a certain condition is met. We specifically explored the loops "for", "while" and "do-while".
